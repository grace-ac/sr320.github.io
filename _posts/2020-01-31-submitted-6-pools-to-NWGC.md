Today I submitted 6 pooled samples of Crab RNA to NWGC for QC. After they run QC, they'll let us know what our sequencing options are. 

#### GitHub Issue: [#798](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/798)

Pooled the samples originally on [Nov 22nd, 2019](https://grace-ac.github.io/pooled-6-new-samples/) 

After pooling, I realized I had to have samples concentrated to NWGC minimum requirement of 50 ng/ul... so I attempted to concentrate them using a kit from Zymo after it arrived in the mail. 

Attempt at concentrating was unsuccessful becuase I didn't do the correct volume of RNA Binding Buffer (post: [here](https://grace-ac.github.io/concentrate-test-pools/)). 

Sam recommended I contact NWGC and ask if we can still get some sequencing done even though our samples are not at their requirements, which brought us to today! 

I put the 6 pooled samples in a plate that was provided by Jeff Weiss at NWGC, and walked them over there.

They will do QC testing, and then let us know what our sequencing options are afterwards. 

Here's manifest of what I submitted today:
