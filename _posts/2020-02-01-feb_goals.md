## Looking back on [January](https://grace-ac.github.io/January-goals/)

### Crab
- I submitted the 6 pooled samples on a plate to NWGC yesterday!
- AMSS talk went well! I didn't do any new analyses, but made my GSS talk better! 

### Oyster
- didn't touch it at all... :( TA work takes up quite a bit of time and brain energy, it turns out! 

### Other
- Sent my MS proposal to committee members and received comments and suggestions - currently working on addressing them. 

### Attended and presented at AMSS and had a great time!
