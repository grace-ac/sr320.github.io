## September
### Crab:    
- Keep tabs on data - when it arrives, begin trimming, assembling, annotating process
- **Prepare for PCSGA: take some of [what I presented for EIMD 2019](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f_oxwDb60UwgQko5ZUR7wPE4PleBjrn-dKp-cFzeUGU/edit#slide=id.g5ce25782cd_0_92), and add more about the research project**
- Interview Genevieve and Shanelle for DecaPod episodes

### Oysterseed:     
- Publish raw data and percolator files to PRiDE (once Emma gets back to me)     
- Once that is done and everything is looked over, publish to BioRxiv

## Looking back on August:
August post: [here](https://grace-ac.github.io)    
### **Research**
I fixed the crab data sheet and now have a near complete (unsure if I'm missing a few) list of samples used and what was done with them: [here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/blob/master/analyses/master-qubit-sample.csv)  

I have been waiting for the sequence data to arrive and have been reading my old posts, and Sam's old posts related to the next steps. Still haven't received data.     

### **Outreach**
I still haven't done any of them. Genevieve has been busy, and Shanelle has been working on her RNA extractions. Have plans to get those done this month. 

### **Conferences**
I have a list of potential and definite conferences that might be good for me to attend. I have also submitted my title and abstract to PCSGA and will be presenting results for our first assembled transcriptome on September 18th at 4:45pm.

List of conferences of interest:    

| Conference     | Location      | Dates       | Abstract due |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| **PCSGA**      | Portland, OR  | 9/17-9/19   | submitted    |
| Ocean Sciences | San Diego, CA | 02/16-02/21 | 9/11/2019    |
| **NSA**        | Baltimore, MD | 03/29-04/02 |              |
| **AMSS**       | Anchorage, AK | ???         |              |

**Bolded** are ones I'm definitely attending.    
AMSS is the one for NPRB, but according to Pam they are only interested in final results... also [their website](https://www.alaskamarinescience.org) does not say when their 2020 conference will be. 

### **Other**: 
I cleaned up the [RobertsLab/project-crab](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-crab) and my repository for the Oysterseed paper and project, [grace-ac/paper-pacific.oyster-larvae](https://github.com/grace-ac/paper-pacific.oyster-larvae).
