Today in Hackweek, we went over what I could do to have a better hold on my crab data sheets... details in post

Sam, Yaamini, Laura, and Steven all helped with identifying some options to try. 

It may be possible to one day have a true master spreadsheet, but I think in order to be sure about what we have left in our freezer, I'm going to focus on just keeping track of which samples we've extracted RNA from, and how much, if any, of the slurry remains in the freezer.

I'll try keeping an excel file with all of the RNA qubit and isolation data, keeping track of RNA extraction method, qubit results, and maybe some other things.

I'll then use R to join that master qubit and RNA isolation file with the hemolymph sampling data.

Will start working on this tomorrow.
