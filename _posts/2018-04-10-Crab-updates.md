Updates on RNA isolation and Qubit progress and DecaPod progress and plan. Finally post S1E1 on project background!

### Qubit and RNA isolation
I ran Qubit yesterday on 14 tubes that I had previously isolated RNA from. The results are:

and
[Here](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/scaphapoda/grace/Crab-project/Qubit/QubitData_2018-04-09_13-38-37.csv)

Today, I ran Qubit on two samples that I isolated RNA from in the early stages of this process. This means that the protocol I used was different than the one I currently am using. There are less centrifuge and mixing steps. However, I ran them on the Qubit because I somehow ended up choosing those two crabs as part of the subset of surviving crabs for my current RNA isolation samples. 

To demonstrate a little more clearly what I mean: Below is the subset of hemolymph samples I chose to isolate RNA from:

The two samples (88 and 36) highlighted are samples that I tried out the protocol on a little over a month ago or so. 

I had not intended to select samples that I had already isolated for the [subset](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/scaphapoda/grace/Crab-project/samples-for-RNA-isolation.xlsx), but I mistakenly did. The [Qubit results](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/scaphapoda/grace/Crab-project/Qubit/QubitData_2018-04-10_14-47-43.csv) were good, though.      
Tube 36 --> 4.16 ng/µL      
Tube 88 --> 2.81 ng/µL

I am going to have to ask Sam and/or Steven about whether I should pick a different set of samples becuase the RNA isolation protocol was slightly different between what I used on tube 88 and 36 and what I am currently using. 

### DecaPod
I published [episode 1](https://bittercrab.wordpress.com/2018/04/10/decapod-s1e1-project-background/) FINALLY! Pam and I sat down at the end of last week's crab meeting #2 to record a little background info.

Now that that is finally finished, I am going to start editing the other recordings I have and release one next week, and the other the following week. 

I have the recording of Crab Mtg #2 (next week's podcast)    
and another of Pam answering some of my questions about the experimental design as well as some questions that others have asked me and I was unable to answer.
