Between trying to add some edits and clean things up for the 2015 Oysterseed project paper, I've been reading protocols for other RNA extraction kits. Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Mircoprep Plus Kit, Zymo Directzol RNA MiniPrep... Details in post

#### Zymo Research Quick-DNA/RNA Microprep Plus Kit
Cat. D7005        
[Manual pdf](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7005_quick-dna-rna_microprep_plus_kit.pdf)

This was recommended to Sam and I from Pam. Sam requested a free sample, which should be arriving some time this week. 

#### Zymo Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep
Cat. R2050       
[Manual pdf](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/ZymoResearch_Directzol_RNA_MiniPrep.pdf)

We already have this from when Hollie was here in 2016. There's one box that's opened, and one unopened 50rxns kit box. 

## This week
### Crab         
I'll be able to try out both kits (Microprep should arrive this week; we already have Direct-zol)     

### Oysterseed   
[paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OaYNzlOJr5QibCYt8--GMNGvXlzHPR9_daCkNUVkj-U/edit)      
Intro: update it and tailor it more to the project                      
Methods: get them in a solid state - address all comments and get details right       
Results: identify all results and include in paper; are we using phenotypic data even though I can't get it for just the control silos?            
Discussion: write it up after results are finalized     

Skyline document: finish publishing it to Panorama (need project title, abstract in order to finalize publication)     
**Have this all done by next Wednesday**         
I think once the results are finalized, I'll feel able to finish up Intro and Discussion
