I tested out the RNA isolation protocol for the first time today, as well as have run into some difficulty in re-doing the DIA protocol. 


## RNA isolation

I (hopefully) successfully isolated RNA from samples 465 and 468 today! 

I followed exactly what I posted on [Tuesday](https://github.com/grace-ac/grace-ac.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2018-02-13-RNA-isolation-protocol-for-tomorrow.md). I have some clarifications to add to it, though, that Sam helped me with.

I placed the two tubes containing the isolated RNA in the -80, in the box with the pellets of yellow-capped tubes (box 5 of 5), tray 14, column 4, row 4. They are two snap-cap tubes labeled "465" and "468".

#### Next week:
Use Qubit to determine if I actuallly got any RNA in the two samples tubes!

## DIA Analysis

I am stuck on [Step 3a](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/DIA-data-Analyses.md#step-3a-create-two-text-files-that-indicate-path-for-1-the-reference-peptide-list-in-silico-protein-digestion-and-2-spectra-data-mzml-files) again. This happened last time and I found the old GitHub issue [#118](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/118). I currently can't stop thinking about food, so I think I'll have to call it a day and go get some dinner! I'll figure this out/create new GitHub issues next week.
