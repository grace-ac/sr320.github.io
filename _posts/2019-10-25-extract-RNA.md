Today I ran 2ul of the 24 samples I extracted yesterday. 20 out of 24 had RNA. Details in post. 

### Prep
Labeled tubes
- 24 RNase-free snap cap tubes (for preparing the 35ul sample)
- 24 RNase-free snap cap tubes (with C. bairdi RNA, tube number, and date)
- 24 yellow zymo spin column lids (**Next time also label collection tube**)
- 24 clear zymo spin column lids

Grabbed 100% ethanol in a 15ml tube, and RNase-free water in a 15ml tube. 

P1000, P200, P20 and tips

### Sample prep

1. Let pelleted hemolymph thaw, then vortexed for a second.
2. Transfered 35ul of the slurry to a labeled snap cap tube (some tubes (27, 62, 19) only contained ~35ul, whereas other tubes still had a lot left). 
3. Added 35ul of RNase free water
4. Added 280 ul Lysis buffer 
5. Mixed all 350ul of liquid by vortexing. 

### Purification
1. Transfered 350ul of sample into yellow spin column.
2. Spun 10,000 g 30s. 
3. Saved DNA on the column for later. 
4. Saved flowthrough with RNA and continued
5. Added 350ul 100% ethanol and pipet to mix.
6. Transfer all 700ul to clear spin column. 
7. Spun 10,000 g 30 s. 
Discard flow-through

At the end of Step 7, there was white crystal-y stuff in tubes 144, 8. 

8. Added 400ul DNA/RNA prep buffer. Spun 10,000g 30 s

At end of Step 8, tubes 15, 10, 53, 121 still had some liquid on the column

9. Add 700 ul DNA/RNA wash buffer. Spin 10,000 g 30s 

At end of step 9, 163, 10, 121, still had liquid on column. Spun these again at 10,000 g 30 s. Then they were fine. 

10. Added 400 ul DNA/RNA wash buffer. Spin 10,000 g 2 minutes. Transfered column to fully labeled RNase-free snap caps.
11. Added 15ul RNase-free water to column matrix and let sit for 5 minutes. Spun to elute 10,000 g 2 minutes.

Put samples in -80C over night becuase I left. 

### Qubit
Ran 2ul of each sample on Qubit. 

20/24 samples had RNA.
