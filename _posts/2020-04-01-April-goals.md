### Reflecting on [March's Goals](https://grace-ac.github.io/march-goals/):
## Crab:
- NSA was cancelled, so I didn't work on anything 
- I focused on finishing TA duties and oyster paper

## Oyster:
didn't finish - likely to finish solid draft this week!

## Other
- I've start blocking out chunks of time every week for specific tasks and it's helped with productivity!
- MS defense date is roughly aimed for being early in the second week of June... needs to be solidified still.
