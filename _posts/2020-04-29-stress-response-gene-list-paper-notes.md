Today I made a new crab stress response table with more information. I also started an outline for the intro based on the meeting I had with Steven yesterday. I've been reading/finding resources about crab/crustacean immunity and macropinocytosis. Will add more to intro and discussion as I learn more. 

### New stress response gene list
Rmd: [042720-get_crab-stress_response-genelist.Rmd](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/blob/master/scripts/042720-get_crab-stress_response-genelist.Rmd)    

New list: [crab_stress-response-genes.tab](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/blob/master/analyses/crab_stress-response-genes.tab) 

The new list now has `BLAST` output from the crab transcriptome and the Uniprot-SP-GO information `join`-ed with the "stress response" list. 

### Crab paper
Working on:    
- Intro (reading about crab immunity to add to intro)    
- Results (will describe transcriptome more)
- Discussion (will add more about macropinocytosis and what it means)
