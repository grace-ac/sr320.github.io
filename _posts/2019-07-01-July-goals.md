I am currently taking the Ecology of Infectious Marine Disease course at UW Friday Harbor Labs until July 19th. It's been super fun and has really made me even more excited to be in this field and studying disease!  

In the meantime, some things I hope to accomplish before the end of the month are:     
- Tying up the ends of the KCl and dose duration experiments, and the egg development work from Taylor Hatchery. Make a few plots, think about what could have been done better, what went well, etc.
- Revisit the process that was involved in assembling the transcriptome and annotation, etc. for our first crab library, and  work on having a more detailed plan for when the samples come back.
