Today we checked to see what development occurred since Wednesday's strip spawn and KCl-treatment trials. There were so few eggs in the tripours to begin with, that there ended up being way too small of numbers of D-hinge larvae that I ended up dumping the trial and we'll have to rethink this and re-do it. Details in post. 

### Counts using coulter counter
We started out using the coulter counter to see if it would work. We screened the tripours (used 31-33 because those are the extras) on 60micron screens. We realized quickly that there was a lot of larger junk that stayed in the sample, including pollen because the table wasn't covered over the two days. We then swithed to screening with a 90micron screen into a 60 in order to catch the big stuff. I suspended them in 10ml seawater. 

The first counts of the coulter counter were pretty high, but then the next two tripours were very low. Counts listed below:   

Counts are #cells/ml in 10ml samples. 

| Tripour No. | Trtmnt                       | Count 1 | Count 2 | Count 3 | Avg  |
|-------------|------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|------|
| 1           | 0mM KCl                      | 86      | 75      | 85      | 82   |
| 16          | 50mM KCl with hydration step | 13      | 12      | 11      | 12   |
| 25          | 80mM KCl                     | 29      | 43      | 34      | 36   |

The coulter counter was likely counting things that weren't D-hinge. 


### Counts by hand
We then decided to do counts by hand. I screened them the same way and suspended them in 10ml seawter just like with the coulter counter. 

I sampled out 1ml after mixing well by flipping contatiner upside-down a few times. I put the sample on a slide and put two drops of lugols in order to preserve the organisms so that they wouldn't be moving around when I was trying to count them. 

The counts were also very low. I didn't count all tripours - I just started out by looking at a bunch of different treatments to see if it was worth me continuing and counting them all. Counts are below:      

Counts are #D-hinge/1ml in 10ml samples       
 

| Tripour No. | Trtmnt                     | Count/ml | Total No. |
|-------------|----------------------------|----------|-----------|
| 2           | 0mM KCl                    | 0        | 0         |
| 4           | 10mM KCl                   | 4        | 40        |
| 8           | 20mM KCl                   | 6        | 60        |
| 17          | 50mM KCl + hydration step  | 7        | 70        |
| 18          | 50mM KCl + hydration step  | 10       | 100       |
| 19          | 60mM KCl                   | 3        | 30        |
| 26          | 80mM KCl                   | 0        | 0         |
| 27          | 80mM KCl                   | 3        | 30        |
| 29          | 50mM KCl without hydration | 3        | 30        |

The numbers are way too small to have too much meaning. Each tripour originally had ~10,000 eggs, so in terms of percentages, the number of eggs that made it to D-hinge range from 0%-0.01%. 

### Notes from this trial/things to change for next time
- Didn't have a true "negative control". A true negative control would have been having a tripour of just eggs (no sperm added to fertilize) 
- 10,000 eggs/tripour is sticking with the 10eggs/ml rule that the hatchery has, but maybe it's too small a scale for capturing any differences in this experiment. Maybe try putting more eggs in the tripours.... or using larger buckets?
- Keep male and female geoduck separate after biopsy punching gonads to determine sex - may be cause of early polar body sightings (see [this post](https://grace-ac.github.io/day1-geo-stripspawn/)).
- Use less treatment groups, easier to manage and may be better to start on a much smaller scale, then get more complex as we learn what works
