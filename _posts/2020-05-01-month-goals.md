### MS thesis

      - _related to above: set an MS defense date_

#### Looking back on [March](https://grace-ac.github.io/march-goals/): 

### Crab
- Didn't speak at NSA --> conference was canceled
- Did start the manuscript!! 
- Have been working on analyses and results 
- Pandemic --> stay home order... so I didn't help with qPCRs 

### Oyster
- I did finish the paper! But I have a lot of great comments by labmates' to address to make it a good paper. 

### other
- I have been working on my One Health capstone here and there - not too hard... a fun and small side project! I only have to give a 25 minute presentation of my findings to the One Health group. No paper needs to be written. 
- Haven't officially set an MS date...
