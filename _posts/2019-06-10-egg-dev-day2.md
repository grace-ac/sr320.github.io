Today we took a look under the scope of the eggs in the silos from Friday's egg development trial ([Notebook post](https://grace-ac.github.io/egg-development/)). 

### Looking at the eggs
I didn't really look at the ones that were fertilized. 

Benoit and I looked at eggs from the three silos that were not fertilized (although I did see polar bodies, cleavage).     

| Treatment group (all not fertilized) | D-hinge? | Notes                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| H50                                  | yes      | don't look great; lots of ciliates; some trochophores                                                                           |
| C                                    | maybe    | lots of ciliates; remnants of trochophores; potential D-hinges,  but hard to know because a lot of things could have been eaten |
| 50                                   | no       | some trochophores; lots of ciliates                                                                                             |
