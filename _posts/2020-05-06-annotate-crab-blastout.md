title: Create annotated crab transcriptome BLAST `join` with uniprot-SP-GO

Worked a lot on the crab paper intro and bits of results and discussion here and there. I also made an annotated BLAST output from the crab transcriptome with the uniprot-SP-GO.sorted file. 

### Create file:
Rmd --> [annotate-crab-transcriptome-blastout.Rmd](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/blob/master/scripts/annotate-crab-transcriptome-blastout.Rmd)

Resulting file --> [rab_transc-sp-GO.tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/master/analyses/crab_transc-sp-GO.tab)

### "Cool" non-enriched DEGs
Steven went through the annotated DEG list [analyses/2019-infection_annot-DEGlist.tab](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/blob/master/analyses/2019-infection_annot-DEGlist.tab) and picked out some cool ones that I can discuss in the Differential Gene Expression section in the Discussion, even though they weren't enriched. (google sheet of genes with some notes: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K4nzyiqT1lhg-8tp0sFfj-ZjcymKxuFjzOYbx8Qb_PY/edit#gid=0))
