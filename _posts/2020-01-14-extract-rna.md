Today I extracted RNA from 24 samples. Day 9, 12 infected and 12 uninfected. I did not run them on the qubit yet. Will do later this week. 

## Samples I used:   

| FRP  | trtmnt_tank | day | infection_status | maturity | tube_number |
|------|-------------|-----|------------------|----------|-------------|
| 6251 | NA          | 9   | 1                | I        | 167         |
| 6263 | NA          | 9   | 1                | I        | 179         |
| 6262 | NA          | 9   | 1                | I        | 168         |

## Method
Pretty much did everything the same as this post: [Oct 25, 2019](https://grace-ac.github.io/extract-RNA/)  

New thing: eluted RNA in 15ul of TE

## Where are they now? 
Extracted RNA are in -80C ([Rack 3, Column 2, Row 3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qsvz3QTURlPF_hX05BQxjom3484WuMfqQ1ILl9LEljU/edit)) 

DNA are in the fridge in FTR 209 - box 2 of _C. bairdi_ DNA. 

Remaining hemolymph samples were placed in Box 2 of the Day 9 (green caps) pellet box (Rack 8, Col 2, Row 5). 

## Next steps: 
Run 2ul on Qubit using RNA HS Kit. 

These might help with bulking up the pooled for NWGC that now no longer make the cut-off for their requirements after I attempted to concentrate the RNA (see post: [01/10/2020](https://grace-ac.github.io/attempt-to-concentrate-6-pooled-samples/)).
