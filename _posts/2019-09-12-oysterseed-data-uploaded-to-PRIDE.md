Today I officially got an email that the RAW oysterseed data and *.elib search files have successfully been uploaded and published on PRIDE. I have some plans for finishing up this oysterseed project by October 20th, details in post. 

### PRIDE submission
Sent the submission in for review yesterday afternoon, heard back this morning that it was approved. 

 Project Name: PROTEOMIC RESPONSE OF EARLY JUVENILE PACIFIC OYSTERS TO TEMPERATURE
 Project accession: PXD015434 
 
 I have to include this information in the [paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OaYNzlOJr5QibCYt8--GMNGvXlzHPR9_daCkNUVkj-U/edit), and a link to it in my [data](https://github.com/grace-ac/paper-pacific.oyster-larvae) directory.
